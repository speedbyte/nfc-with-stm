this firmware has been developped on M24LR04 discovery board by using STVD 4.2.1.

===versions===

1.0 : 
	- first release (21-12-11)

1.1 : 
	- clock management : switch to Low frequency clock during the LCD display 

1.2 : 
	- use the active halt mode for the display of the NDEF message
	- display the negative temperature

1.3 : 
	- optimize the current consumption in the three modes
	- add the revision number of the firware (writen in the lost block of the M24LR04E-R)
	- save the current working mode 
	
=== How to?===

===How program STM8Ldiscovery board with STVD? ===
- connect the Pin19 of the Jtag connector to the DC of the M24LR04 discovery board
- connect the Pin19 of the Jtag connector to the GND of the M24LR04 discovery board
- Plug the SWIM connector on the discovery board 
- set the JP1 jumper on REG3.3 position
- upload the firmware
